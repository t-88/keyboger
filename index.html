<h1> Developing A Bloging Engine</h1>
<p>Hello there, i never made a blog so frogive me if i fucked it up or smth, anyway i decided to start bloging to record my journey and give back to the internet.</p>
<p>so to start it, i wanted to my my own bloging framewrok? compiler/transpiler? engine?. so enjoy the ride i think.</p>
<h2> Step1: Syntax</h2>
<p>we need to set our language syntax before we even start, this why i am writing a blog about a bloging engine, i am gonna use the cur source and turn it to a blog,</p>
<p>this lang is inspired by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown'>markdown</a>
.</p>
<ul>   '-' un-ordered list notation.</ul>
<ul>   '#' for section and headers.</ul>
<ul>   '::type::arg1::arg2::...' for links, imgs, events, etc.</ul>
<ul>   '[var:value]' macros to configure the document.</ul>
<ul>   '```' for code blocks</ul>
<p>i think thats good enough as a start</p>
